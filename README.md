## Document
For each of the build attempt in Raspberry Pi Zero W - GitLab and Raspberry Pi Zero W - P4wnP1 A.L.O.A, errors that occur had been recorded down and explained.  
If I was about to solve the issue/error at hand, a solution have been recorded down.  
For each of the issue, a error log will be provided. Some error logs may be too large in size to be able to view directly from GitHub.
