# Achieving Composite Mode on Raspberry Pi
## 1. Raspberry Pi Zero W - GitLab
Records the different attempts to rebuild the P4wnP1 ALOA image file using the built script from https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/kali-arm/-/blob/master/raspberry-pi-zero-w-p4wnp1-aloa.sh.   
At the same time, the different errors and solution have also been noted down and explained.

## 2. Raspberry Pi Zero W - P4wnP1 A.L.O.A
Records the different attempts to rebuild the P4wnP1 ALOA image file using the built script from https://github.com/RoganDawes/P4wnP1_aloa/blob/master/build_support/rpi0w-nexmon-p4wnp1-aloa.sh  
At the same time, the different errors and solution have also been noted down and explained.

## 3. Libcomposite
Turn the Raspberry Pi Zero W into a composite gadget.

# Conducting Procotring on Student's PC
Shows the research on different ways the Raspberry Pi Zero W can conduct proctoring on the Student's PC 
**Prerequisite**
- The Raspberry Pi has already been configured to achieve composite mode (See Libcomposite for more info)
- The Raspberry Pi has internet connection
